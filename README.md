Travel Mexico

Travel Mexico has been created to demonstrate the beautiful country of Mexico to potential tourists.  Highlighting
accommodations, culture, history. The purpose is to encourage people to go on holiday to Mexico.

Having travelled to Mexico many times myself (and plan to retire there), tourism is essential to its economy and should be visited by as many people as possible.

Bugs:
Mid-way through building this project, any update to CSS was not updating the browser view of the project.  Having googled this, I see this is a bug.  The original GitHub Repo for this project was: https://github.com/Jtune89/Milestone1_v.3.0
I had to re-create the repo and copy over all code & images that were on the previous one.  This resolved the issue.

When checking the HTML in W3C validator, contactus page had a bug where the form section lacked a heading.  This was corrected and a header added

When checking the CSS code, W3C validator showd Forward is not a animation-fill-mode - which is clearly incorrect as it is and it functions.
